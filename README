I normally clone this directory into my home directory and then make symlinks
from the normal location of the dot-file to the git-controlled file.  I
normally put the file into the git project without the beginning dot.

E.g.,

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:bohnsack/DotFiles.git
    ln -sf ~/DotFiles/screenrc ~/.screenrc
